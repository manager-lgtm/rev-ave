# ROI Calculator Section Accuracy Improvements

## âœ… **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Section Title Mismatch**
**Problem**: The service detail section was titled "Investment ROI Calculator" but only displayed static ROI metrics, not an interactive calculator
**Solution**: Updated the title to accurately reflect the content

**Before**:
```jsx
<span className="ra-text-primary text-2xl font-black">Investment ROI Calculator</span>
```

**After**: 
```jsx
<span className="ra-text-primary text-2xl font-black">Investment ROI Metrics</span>
```

### **2. Section Description Clarity**
**Problem**: Description implied interactive calculation capabilities
**Solution**: Updated description to clearly indicate these are metrics based on typical results

**Before**:
```jsx
<CardDescription className="text-center ra-text-secondary">
  Based on typical client results investing in {service.title}
</CardDescription>
```

**After**:
```jsx
<CardDescription className="text-center ra-text-secondary">
  Expected return metrics based on typical client results for {service.title}
</CardDescription>
```

### **3. CTA Button Clarity**
**Problem**: Hero button said "See ROI Calculator" which was confusing since it goes to the pricing calculator page
**Solution**: Updated button text to accurately describe the destination

**Before**:
```jsx
<DollarSign className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
See ROI Calculator
```

**After**:
```jsx
<Calculator className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
Try Pricing Calculator
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Current System Architecture**

### **ROI Metrics Section (Service Detail Page)**:
- **Location**: Within individual service detail tabs
- **Content**: Static metrics showing expected ROI timeline (Month 1-2, Month 3-6, etc.)
- **Purpose**: Display typical client results for that specific service
- **Title**: "Investment ROI Metrics" âœ… **Accurate**

### **Pricing Calculator (Separate Page)**:
- **Location**: `/pricing-calculator` route 
- **Content**: Interactive calculator with service selection, bundle discounts, payment options
- **Purpose**: Allow users to calculate custom pricing based on service combinations
- **Access**: "Try Pricing Calculator" button âœ… **Accurate**

### **Button Flow Logic**:
1. **"Try Pricing Calculator"** â†’ Opens interactive pricing calculator page
2. **Fallback**: If pricing calculator handler fails â†’ Opens contact page
3. **Analytics**: Tracks `calculator_used` event with source page data

## ðŸ“Š **Content Accuracy Improvements**
