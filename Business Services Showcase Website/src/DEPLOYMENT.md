# Deployment Guide for Revenue Avenue

## Quick Start: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

Vercel is the **recommended** hosting platform for this React application. It's free, fast, and optimized for React/Vite apps.

### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (Easiest - No Code Changes)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Revenue Avenue"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select your Revenue Avenue repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - **That's it!** Vercel auto-detects everything

3. **Your site is live**:
   - You'll get a URL like: `revenue-avenue.vercel.app`
   - You can add a custom domain later

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```
   - Follow the prompts
   - Accept defaults (Vercel auto-detects Vite)
   - Your site deploys in ~60 seconds

4. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### What Happens During Deployment?

Vercel automatically:
- âœ… Detects Vite/React framework
- âœ… Installs dependencies (`npm install`)
- âœ… Builds your app (`npm run build`)
- âœ… Deploys to global CDN
- âœ… Enables HTTPS
- âœ… Sets up automatic deployments for future pushes

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "command not found"
- Make sure `package.json` has build script
- Check Node version compatibility (v18+ recommended)

### Routes don't work (404 on refresh)
- Vercel: Already configured in `vercel.json`
- Netlify: Add `_redirects` file with `/* /index.html 200`

### Assets not loading
- Check `base` path in `vite.config.js`
- For subdirectory deployments, set `base: '/subdirectory/'`
